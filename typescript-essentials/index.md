## Reflections

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**. From this module, I've learned what is typescript and what advantages does it give when using it. I installed TypeScript and set up a TypeScript project in Visual Studio Code with help of this topic.
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**. I've learned how declare variables using primitive types, object types, about union/intersection/literal types. I understood the importance of using static types, because it provides better documentation, and allows TypeScript to validate that my code is working correctly.
3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**. I've got that interfaces are a feature of TypeScript that allows us to define the structure of an object,the properties and methods that an object should have without implementation. I learned how declare, instantiate and extend an interface in TypeScript. I've understood that interfaces improve readability and reusability of code, and it helps to make refactoring easier.
4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**. From this module, I've caught information about different types of creating functions with TS, about possibility to define functions with optional, default, and rest parameters, as well as deconstructed object parameters. It will enhances my code quality and reduce bugs.
5. **Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**. I've learned about TypeScript-specific features like type annotations for class members, access modifiers, and the ability to specify required or optional parameters. This module helped me to understand the principles of OOP better and the possibilities of using them with TypeScript
6. **Generics in TypeScript**. From this unit, I've understood that generics are a TypeScript feature that allows us to pass in various types of data and create reusable code to handle different inputs. Generics offer us multiple benefits, such as type safety and error detection, code reusability and flexibility etc.
7. **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**. This module introduced me to modules in TypeScript. I've learned that export/import statements makes a component in one module available to other modules. Modules usage helps us to better organize and structure our codebase.
8. **Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**. This module explained me importance of namespaces which allow us to group variables, functions, interfaces, or classes; differences between modules and namespaces. I've learned how to organize TypeScript code using namespaces, what ways to compile multiple file namespaces are.
