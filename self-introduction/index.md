Hi there. Today with you again for the monthly column - "Interview with stranger". And today our guest is front-en developer - Julia. Julia, I have a couple of questions for you. Ans the first one, have you wanted to become a developer since childhood?

#### __Julia:__
No, of course not. Because in my childhood I wanted to be a fashion model. But I loved mathematics and solving different task, so after 9th grade I entered the physics and mathematics class of Lyceum No. 1 Grodno city. But then I again turned in the wrong direction, because I took part in the regional olympiad in chemistry, took second place and decided to enter the Chemistry Faculty. I think at this moment everyone will imagine the famous Heisenberg from the TV series Breaking Bad, but in reality everything was not like that. And only after 6 years of working in a chemical laboratory I decided to try a new field  - IT world specifically frontend.

#### __Presenter:__
Sounds interesting. But why frontend, because there are many other areas that maybe more suitable for girls, such as business analysis, project management, design?

#### __Julia:__
It was also a long and difficult way too. Because first I completed courses to become a project manager and even worked as a Scrum Master in a law company. But constant meetings, negotiations and calls really exhausted me. And I always wanted to see the concrete result of my work, which was impossible in such a profession. So one day my friend sent me a link to a video on YouTube about website layout and I decided to try writing code. And It turned out to be very catching and exciting for me.

#### __Presenter:__
Such an inspiring story of finding yourself. And how did you learn frontend, yourself or maybe with some courses?

#### __Julia:__
After some month of myself study, I found an excellent free community school, Rolling Scopes, where there is a whole training program and activists and mentors help students at every step.

#### __Presenter:__
Sounds excellent to start, I think. Was it easy for you or maybe challenging?

#### __Julia:__
No, it was really challenging for me, because it was a very large amount of new information in a short time. But the program was well structured, so from the basics of HTML and CSS, we moved on to learning javascript, then OOP, asynchronous programming, typescript, and finally react.

#### __Presenter:__
Julia/ and my last question. What motivates you on your way?

#### __Julia:__
I loved writing code and seeing how elements appear on a new page, take the right place and the user can interact with them. I like learning something new. I understood that I could develop in a new profession endlessly, because new technologies are constantly appearing. But I always had a backup plan, because Iâ€™ve been doing pole dance for 6 years now.

Thanks for your honest answers. Wish you good luck and interesting tasks in our company
